# Horiseon-challenge1
In this project I was asked to essentially tidy up code that was provided by Horiseon for their website.
I was able to cut down the style.css page by 65 lines, I did this by removing several unecessary classes and merging multiple elements which did the same thing.
I added several comments to both the html and css pages for clarity including alt attributes to describe images.
I was able to do this in one sitting which is why I have so few commits.
